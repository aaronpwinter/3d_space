# 3d_space
Custom 3D Graphics Engine

Requires PyGame (pygame_example.py) -> "pip install pygame"

Running pygame_example.py as a script will load an example of the engine. Use w to move forward, s backwards, a left, d right, space up, and shift down. Holding control will increase the speed of these movements. All movements are relative to camera direction. To rotate the camera, click and drag the direction you want to rotate.
